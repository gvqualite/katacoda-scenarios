For this sample, we will create a file named index.js

## Step 1: Include the SDK in the code file

The package is named 'obs-demo-api' and it can be included with the standard instruction <i>require</i> of NodeJS
 
<pre class="file" data-filename="index.js" data-target="append">
var obsapi = require("obs-demo-api")
</pre>
